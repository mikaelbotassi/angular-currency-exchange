## Card Header Component

The `CardHeaderComponent` is used to display a header in a card with a customizable title.

### Usage

```
<app-card-header>
  Header Title
</app-card-header>
```

### Properties

No properties are required for this component. The header title is provided as content within the `<app-card-header>` tags.

### Custom Styles

The component uses custom CSS styles to style the card header. You can customize these styles as needed in your application.

#### SCSS

```
.card-header {
  padding: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: var(--card-header-bg);
}
```

### Change Detection Strategy

This component utilizes the `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` strategy to optimize performance by ensuring changes are detected only when component inputs change.

### Example

```
<app-card-header>
  My Custom Title
</app-card-header>
```

In this example, a card header will be displayed with the title "My Custom Title."

### Notes

Be sure to provide content within the `<app-card-header>` tags to set the card header title. You can also customize the card header styles according to your application's needs.

This component is intended to be used as part of a larger card and can be embedded within other card components to create a customized look.
