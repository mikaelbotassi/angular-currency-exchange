# LogoComponent

The Loader component is used to display a loading animation while data is fetched or processed in the application.

## Usage

To use the component loader you must import the SharedModule in your component's module, or if it is a Standalone component you must import it within 'imports'.

After that, you just need to choose when to render it and use it with the: `<app-loader>`
