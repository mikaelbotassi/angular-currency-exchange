# CurrencyListComponent

The `CurrencyListComponent` is a component responsible for displaying a list of different currency cards, including Canadian Dollar (CAD), Argentine Peso (ARS), and British Pound Sterling (GBP) exchange rate information. It serves as a container for these currency cards.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the `CurrencyListComponent` consists of a `<main>` element containing a `<div>` with the class `container`. Inside the container, there are three child components: `<app-dolar-canadense-card>`, `<app-peso-argentino-card>`, and `<app-libra-esterlina-card>`. These child components represent individual currency cards and display exchange rate information.

## CSS Styling

The CSS styling for the `CurrencyListComponent` is designed to provide a responsive layout for the currency cards. Here are the key styles:

- `main`: This element serves as the main container for the component. It sets padding, alignment, and responsive layout properties.

- `.container`: This class styles the container inside the main element. It controls the width, alignment, gap between child components, and responsive behavior.

- Media Queries: There are two media queries included to adjust the layout based on screen width (`min-width`). These media queries modify padding and child component width to ensure a visually pleasing and responsive layout on different screen sizes.

## TypeScript

The TypeScript file for the `CurrencyListComponent` defines the component class. It doesn't contain any specific logic apart from its constructor.

## Usage

To use the `CurrencyListComponent` in your Angular application, include it in your template where you want to display a list of currency cards. The component automatically displays the Canadian Dollar (CAD), Argentine Peso (ARS), and British Pound Sterling (GBP) exchange rate cards.

Example usage in a template:

```
<app-currency-list></app-currency-list>
```

This component simplifies the process of displaying currency exchange rate information in a structured and responsive manner.
