## Card Component

The `CardComponent` is used to create a card-like container for displaying content with a shadowed box and rounded corners.

### Usage

```
<app-card>
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</app-card>
```

### Custom Styles

The component uses custom SCSS styles to style the card container. You can customize these styles as needed in your application.

#### SCSS

```
article {
  box-shadow: 0 0.125rem 0.25rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075);
  background-color: var(--card-bg);
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Change Detection Strategy

This component utilizes the `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` strategy to optimize performance by ensuring changes are detected only when component inputs change.

### Example

```
<app-card>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>This is some content inside the card.</p>
</app-card>
```

In this example, the `CardComponent` is used to create a card-like container for displaying content. You can place any content you like inside the card.

### Notes

- Be sure to provide content within the `<app-card>` tags to populate the card with your desired content.
- You can customize the card's appearance by modifying the provided CSS styles or adding additional styles as needed.

This component is designed to help you create visually appealing cards for displaying content within your application.

For more information on styling and usage customization, refer to your application's style and usage documentation.

This concludes the documentation for the `CardComponent`. Ensure you integrate it correctly into your application and customize it as needed.
