# Quote Model Documentation
___

The `Quote` model represents exchange rate data for a specific currency. It provides various properties to access information about the currency's exchange rate.

## Properties

The `Quote` model has the following properties:

1. `codein` (string): The code of the currency.

2. `name` (string): The name of the currency.

3. `high` (string): The highest exchange rate value.

4. `low` (string): The lowest exchange rate value.

5. `varBid` (string): The variation bid.

6. `pctChange` (string): The percentage change.

7. `bid` (string): The bid value.

8. `ask` (string): The ask value.

9. `timestamp` (string): The timestamp of the exchange rate data.

10. `create_date` (string): The creation date of the exchange rate data.

## Constructor

The `Quote` constructor allows you to create a new instance of the `Quote` model. You can provide the currency name as an optional parameter.

```
constructor(name: string = "") {
  // Initialize properties
  this._codein = "";
  this._name = name;
  this._high = "";
  this._low = "";
  this._varBid = "";
  this._pctChange = "";
  this._bid = "";
  this._ask = "";
  this._timestamp = "";
  this._create_date = "";
}
```

## Getters and Setters

The `Quote` model includes getters and setters for each property, allowing you to get and set their values.

- Example of using getters and setters:

  ```
  const currency = new Quote("USD");
  currency.codein = "USD";
  const code = currency.codein; // Returns "USD"
  ```
